### 1. Introduction
This is my file management page, where I continuously save all of my previous learning notes and new notes to come. All files are saved in either **Markdown** or **PDF** format, and therefore, they are read-only on the page and cannot be modified directly. I also published my completed projects, papers, and more here, with detailed copyright and reference information when applicable.


### 2. Doc Type
My documents include the following:

1. **Notes:** My learning notes, including knowledge from major courses, elective courses, and self-improvement. The ***PDF viewer*** will be incessantly maintained and updated.
2. **Programs:** Projects I have completed, or frameworks for future projects are saved in ***Markdown*** format, with the code portion separately labeled.
3. **Resume:** My personal resume, keep updating.
