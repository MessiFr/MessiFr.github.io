# Exploring Model For Pollen Count

In this notebook, we will perform data preprocessing for the pollen count data. We will also apply feature selection methods on the dataset. We will try several regression models to compare and discuss the most reasonable and appropriate model.

```

## Preprocessing Steps
First we load the backup datasets: weather dataset and the grass count dataset:


```python
weather_dict = pickle.load(/docs/projects/capstone/Modeling/regressor/open('weather_v2.pkl', "rb"))
# grass_df = pd.read_csv(/docs/projects/capstone/Modeling/regressor/'preprocessing/grass_clean_mel.csv')
grass_df = pd.read_csv(/docs/projects/capstone/Modeling/regressor/'preprocessing/clean_data.csv')

grass_df['Count Date'] = grass_df['Count Date'].apply(/docs/projects/capstone/Modeling/regressor/lambda x:datetime.datetime.strptime(x, '%Y-%m-%d'))
grass_df['non_grass'] = grass_df['Total'] - grass_df['grass_count']
```

According to the website of Melbourne pollen, the grass pollen is classified into four levels, low (/docs/projects/capstone/Modeling/regressor/0-19), medium(20-49), high(50-99) and extreme(100+). So we add "label" column in the grass dataset.

label = [[100, 1], [50, 2], [20, 3], [-1, 4]]

def get_label(/docs/projects/capstone/Modeling/regressor/x):
    """

    """
    for i in label:
        if x >= i[0]:
            return i[1]

# add new column "label"
grass_df['label'] = grass_df['grass_count'].apply(/docs/projects/capstone/Modeling/regressor/lambda x:get_label(x))
```


```python
# extract full city names
grass_df['Name'] = grass_df['Name'].apply(/docs/projects/capstone/Modeling/regressor/lambda x:x.split('_')[0])

Now, we extract and merge data that only related to "Melbourne" and eatract the useful columns.


```python
grass_columns = ['Count Date', 'Elevation', 'Total', 'Location', 'SchColTime', 'grass_count', 'label']
data = grass_df.loc[grass_df['Name']=='Melbourne'][grass_columns]

/docs/projects/capstone/Modeling/regressor/weather_dict[1]['date'] = weather_dict[1].index

for i in [1, 25, 28, 29]:
    tmp = pd.merge(/docs/projects/capstone/Modeling/regressor/data.loc[data['Location']==i], weather_dict[1], left_on='Count Date', right_on='date', how='left')
    melbourne_df = pd.concat(/docs/projects/capstone/Modeling/regressor/[melbourne_df, tmp])
```

Then, we process the new dataset by the following steps.
- drop unused colunms
- check the missing values and dual with the missing values
- sort the df in time order
- add a new column "year" to count each year's data


```python
# 1. drop unused columns
melbourne_df = melbourne_df.drop(/docs/projects/capstone/Modeling/regressor/['Count Date', 'SchColTime'], axis=1)
```


```python
# 2. check missing values

## Visualization
### 1) Correlation plot
In this part, we will show the correlation between each type of features (/docs/projects/capstone/Modeling/regressor/e.g. temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.) and grass count. We fill find out the most related types of features through calculating the average correlation and select the types where their average correlation > 0.1.


```python
def extract_df(/docs/projects/capstone/Modeling/regressor/feature, df, colnames):
    '''
    extract each type of features and grass count to a single dataframe
    '''
    all_list = list(/docs/projects/capstone/Modeling/regressor/filter(lambda x: feature in x, colnames))
    all_list.append(/docs/projects/capstone/Modeling/regressor/'grass_count')
    all_list.append(/docs/projects/capstone/Modeling/regressor/'year')
    one_df = df[all_list]

    return one_df
```

We record df of each type of feature and their correspoding avearge correlation values into two dictionaries.


```python
feature_dict = {}
corr_dict = {}

### 3) Distribution of grass pollen count

## Modelling
### Dataset
- We have 172 variables in total.</br>
- The numerical target variable is 'grass count'.
- We decide to use dataset from 2000 to 2019 as our training dataset.
- And the rest of the data are testing dataset, i.e., data of 2020 and 2021 (/docs/projects/capstone/Modeling/regressor/2020-10-02 to 2021-01-31)

### Type of model
#### <font color=Blue>1. Regression Model. LightBM Regressor</font>

<b>LightGBM is a gradient boosting framework that uses tree based learning algorithm.</b>

- Splits: LightGBM offers gradient-based one-side sampling (/docs/projects/capstone/Modeling/regressor/GOSS) that selects the split using all the instances with large gradients (i.e., large error) and a random sample of instances with small gradients. In order to keep the same data distribution when computing the information gain, /docs/projects/capstone/Modeling/regressor/GOSS introduces a constant multiplier for the data instances with small gradients. Thus, /docs/projects/capstone/Modeling/regressor/GOSS achieves a good balance between increasing speed by reducing the number of data instances and keeping the accuracy for learned decision trees. This method is not the default method for LightGBM, so it should be selected explicitly.

- Leaf growth: LightGBM uses leaf-wise (/docs/projects/capstone/Modeling/regressor/best-first) tree growth. It chooses to grow the leaf that minimizes the loss, allowing a growth of an imbalanced tree. Because it doesn’t grow level-wise, but leaf-wise, overfitting can happen when data is small. In these cases, it is important to control the tree depth. </br>

/docs/projects/capstone/Modeling/regressor/```

#### LightGBM Model 1: use all features for prediction
Now, we need to split the dataset for training and testing.


```python
# training dataset
train_data = melbourne_df.loc[(/docs/projects/capstone/Modeling/regressor/melbourne_df['year'] != "2020") & (melbourne_df['year'] != "2021")]
train_data = melbourne_df.loc[(melbourne_df['year'] != "2020") & (/docs/projects/capstone/Modeling/regressor/melbourne_df['year'] != "2021")]
X_train = train_data.drop(['label', 'Total', 'Location', 'grass_count', 'year', 
                           'date'], axis = 1).reset_index(/docs/projects/capstone/Modeling/regressor/drop = True)
y_train = train_data['grass_count']
print(/docs/projects/capstone/Modeling/regressor/X_train.shape)
print(/docs/projects/capstone/Modeling/regressor/y_train.shape)
```

    (/docs/projects/capstone/Modeling/regressor/1949, 172)
    (/docs/projects/capstone/Modeling/regressor/1949,)



```python
# testing dataset
test_data = melbourne_df.loc[(/docs/projects/capstone/Modeling/regressor/melbourne_df['year'] == "2020") | (melbourne_df['year'] == "2021")]
test_data = melbourne_df.loc[(melbourne_df['year'] == "2020") | (/docs/projects/capstone/Modeling/regressor/melbourne_df['year'] == "2021")]
X_test = test_data.drop(['label', 'Total', 'Location', 'grass_count', 'year', 
                           'date'], axis = 1).reset_index(/docs/projects/capstone/Modeling/regressor/drop = True)
y_test = test_data['grass_count']
print(/docs/projects/capstone/Modeling/regressor/X_test.shape)
print(/docs/projects/capstone/Modeling/regressor/y_test.shape)
```

    (/docs/projects/capstone/Modeling/regressor/120, 172)
    (/docs/projects/capstone/Modeling/regressor/120,)


Then, we can apply LGBMRegressor on the dataset without tuning parameters as the baseline model.


```python
lgbm.fit(/docs/projects/capstone/Modeling/regressor/X_train, y_train)

# Evaluation
print(/docs/projects/capstone/Modeling/regressor/'The R2 score of prediction is: {}'.format(lgbm.score(X_test, y_test))) 
```

    The R2 score of prediction is: 0.13503444192736969


To improve, we use grid search to tune the hyperparameters.


```python
import time

def grid_search(/docs/projects/capstone/Modeling/regressor/pipeline, parameters, X, y):
    '''
    This function is used for grid search to tune the hyperparameters and find out the best one.

##### Tuning the hyperparameters:
1. num_leaves: num_leaves is one of the most important parameters to control the complexity of the model. Large num_leaves can improve the accuracy of the training set and can also increase the chance of being injured by overfitting. A simple approach is that num_leaves = 2^(/docs/projects/capstone/Modeling/regressor/max_depth). We should tune num_leaves with the /docs/projects/capstone/Modeling/regressor/max_depth together.
2. max_depth: This parameter control max depth of each trained tree and will have impact on the best value for the num_leaves parameter, model performance and training time. model will likely be over fit  to the train set if we use a large value of max_depth.
3. min_data_in_leaf: min_data_in_leaf is the minimum number of records a leaf may have and usually deal with the overfitting problem.
4. bagging_fraction: bagging_fraction is the proportion of data used in each iteration to speed up training and reduce overfitting


```python
lgbm_pipeline = Pipeline([
    (/docs/projects/capstone/Modeling/regressor/'clf', LGBMRegressor())

#### LightGBM Model 2: use the most correlated feature for prediction (/docs/projects/capstone/Modeling/regressor/av_temp_scrn)
Now, we need to split the dataset for training and testing.
